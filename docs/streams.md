# Streams

Read 128 characters at a time from the file:
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv").reader do |io|
  while (data = io.read(128))
    p data 
  end
end
~~~

Read one line at a time from the file:
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv").each do |line|
  puts line
end
~~~

Display each row from the csv file as an array:
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv").each(:array) do |array|
  p array
end
~~~

Display each row from the csv file as a hash, where the first line in the CSV file is the header:
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv").each(:hash) do |hash|
  p hash
end
~~~

Write data to the file.
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("abc.txt").writer do |io|
  io << "This"
  io << " is "
  io << " one line\n"
end
~~~

Write lines to the file. By adding `:line` to `writer`, each write appends a new line character. 
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv").writer(:line) do |file|
  file << "these"
  file << "are"
  file << "all"
  file << "separate"
  file << "lines"
end
~~~

Write an array (row) at a time to the file.
Each array is converted to csv before being compressed with zip.

~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv").writer(:array) do |io|
  io << ["name", "address", "zip_code"]
  io << ["Jack", "There", "1234"]
  io << ["Joe", "Over There somewhere", 1234]
end
~~~

Write a hash (record) at a time to the file.
Each hash is converted to csv before being compressed with zip.
The header row is extracted from the first hash write that is performed. 

~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv").writer(:hash) do |stream|
  stream << {name: "Jack", address: "There", zip_code: 1234}
  stream << {zip_code: 1234, address: "Over There somewhere", name: "Joe"}
end
~~~

Notes
* Any additional keys supplied during subsequent write operations will be ignored
  since the header row has already been written to the file. 
* The order of the header and values is determined by the order of the keys supplied 
  during the first write.
* The order of keys in the subsequent writes does not matter. 

Stream into an in-memory buffer, useful for testing. 
The original filename still needs to be supplied so that the streaming pipeline can still be inferred.

~~~ruby
io = StringIO.new
IOStreams.stream(io, file_name: "example.csv.gz").writer(:hash) do |stream|
  stream << {name: "Jack", address: "There", zip_code: 1234}
  stream << {name: "Joe", zip_code: 1234, address: "Over There somewhere"}
end
puts io.string
~~~

Read a CSV file and write the output to an encrypted file in JSON format.

~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("sample.json.enc").writer(:hash) do |output|
  IOStreams.path("sample.csv").each(:hash) do |record|
    output << record
  end
end
~~~

Read a zip file hosted on a HTTP Web Server, returning each row as a hash:
~~~ruby
IOStreams.
  path("https://www5.fdic.gov/idasp/Offices2.zip").
  option(:zip, entry_file_name: "OFFICES2_ALL.CSV").
  each(:hash) do |row|
    p row
  end
~~~

Notes:
* By default IOStreams will read the first file in the zip file. 
* To choose a specific file name within the zip file, supply: `entry_file_name` 

## Notes

* Due to the nature of Zip, both its Reader and Writer methods will create
  a temp file when reading from or writing to a stream.
  Recommended to use Gzip over Zip since it can be streamed without requiring temp files.
* Zip becomes exponentially slower with very large files, especially files
  that exceed 4GB when uncompressed. Highly recommend using GZip for large files.

## Pipeline

If the file is compressed, the pipeline will infer the necessary streams that need to be applied to it:

~~~ruby
path = IOStreams.path("somewhere/example.csv.gz")
# => #<IOStreams::Paths::File:somewhere/example.csv.gz pipeline={:gz=>{}}>
 
path.pipeline
# => {:gz=>{}} 
~~~

The `pipeline` above includes `:gz` to indicate that the file should compressed / decompressed with GZip.

#### Option

Each path supports several options which can be supplied using the `option` method. 

Set the options for a stream in the pipeline for this file. Each stream can only be applied once and is uniquely
identified by its symbolic name.

To see the pipeline of streams that IOStreams would infer: 
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.pgp").pipeline
# => {:pgp=>{}}
 
IOStreams.path("example.gz").pipeline
# => {:gz=>{}}
 
IOStreams.path("example.gz.pgp").pipeline
# => {:gz=>{}, :pgp=>{}}
~~~

If the relevant stream is not found for this file it is ignored.
For example, if the file does not have a pgp extension then the pgp option is ignored.
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv.gz").
  option(:pgp, passphrase: "receiver_passphrase").
  read
~~~

This is great way to pass in stream specific options for when they are required, and to still support
paths that do not use that stream. For example, the same code can support pgp encrypted, Symmetric Encryption encrypted,
and plain text files.
~~~ruby
IOStreams.path("example.csv.enc").
  option(:pgp, passphrase: "receiver_passphrase").
  read
~~~

To see the what value was previously set for a particular option:
~~~ruby 
path = IOStreams.path("example.pgp")
path.option(:pgp, passphrase: "receiver_passphrase")

path.setting(:pgp)
# => {:passphrase=>"receiver_passphrase"}
~~~

#### Stream

The `stream` method stops IOStreams from inferring the streams for this path and only uses the specified streams.

For example when using a filename that does not have the necessary file extensions. 
In this case the file was compressed with Zip, so tell IOStreams to unzip it:  
~~~ruby 
path = IOStreams.path("tempfile2527")
path.stream(:zip)
path.read
~~~

The above example could also be written as:
~~~ruby 
IOStreams.path("tempfile2527").
  stream(:zip).
  read
~~~

Multiple streams can also be specified:

~~~ruby 
IOStreams.path("tempfile2527").
  stream(:zip).
  stream(:pgp, passphrase: "receiver_passphrase").
  read
~~~

Now that IOStreams is not inferring the pipeline from the filename, we can still see the above streams: 
~~~ruby 
IOStreams.path("tempfile2527").
  stream(:zip).
  stream(:pgp, passphrase: "receiver_passphrase").
  pipeline
# => {:zip=>{}, :pgp=>{:passphrase=>"receiver_passphrase"}}
~~~


In this example the file contains JSON data that was compressed with GZip, and since we want to read each row as a hash:
~~~ruby 
IOStreams.path("tempfile2527").
  stream(:zip).
  each(:hash, format: :json) do |row|
    p row
  end
~~~

Alternatively if the original file name is available it can also be supplied allowing IOStreams to infer the above streams:
~~~ruby 
IOStreams.path("tempfile2527", original_file_name: "file.json.gz").
  each(:hash) do |row|
    p row
  end
~~~

To see the what value was previously set for a particular stream:
~~~ruby 
path = IOStreams.path("tempfile2527")
path.stream(:zip)
path.stream(:pgp, passphrase: "receiver_passphrase")

path.setting(:pgp)
# => {:passphrase=>"receiver_passphrase"}
~~~

To ensure no streams are inferred or applied use stream `:none` 
~~~ruby 
path = IOStreams.path("file.zip")
path.stream(:none)
path.read
~~~
